Reusable Component collection built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/). The components are using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling and the documentation is built with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).

## Project setup

As a prerequisite, you need to node and npm installed on your machine. You can download and install them from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).
Ideally, you should use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as your package manager. You can install it by running the following command:

\`\`\`bash
npm install -g pnpm
\`\`\`

Once you have node and pnpm installed, you can install the project dependencies by running the following command:

\`\`\`bash
pnpm install
\`\`\`

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

To start the development server, run the following command:

\`\`\`bash
pnpm storybook
\`\`\`

This will start the Storybook server and open the browser at [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006).
Here you can see the documentation for the components and play around with them.

### Compiles and minifies for production

To build the components for production, run the following command:

\`\`\`bash
pnpm build
\`\`\`

This will build the components and generate the static files in the \`dist\` folder.

### Run your unit tests

The project uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev) for unit and snapshot testing. To run the tests, run the following command:

\`\`\`bash
pnpm test
\`\`\`

### Lints and fixes files

The project uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for linting and formatting. To run the linter, run the following command:

\`\`\`bash
pnpm lint
\`\`\`
